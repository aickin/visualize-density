### Viewing the parcel map

To view some initial parcel-level results, navigate to `/parcels` in your browser. Click on a parcel to see some info. Apologies that the key names are unreadable (they save so much space!). Here's the mapping:

* zn: zone name
* zh: zone height limit
* zp: zone mininum parking per unit
* zd: zone maximum density per acre
* nh: minimum height maximum under SB827
* dh: delta height under SB827

Note: We currently use a bunch of remote layers uploaded to Mapbox, but we can work to enable local development.
